Guidelines for the Reading Group on Philippine Nationalism
1. **Read texts as interventions**. All readings are approached as interventions rather than definitive accounts. Participants are expected to ask what problem a text is responding to, what claims it advances, and what assumptions it takes for granted.
2. **Ground every claim**. Contributions to discussion must be anchored in specific passages, concepts, or historical contexts. Purely impressionistic or unsupported opinions are discouraged in favor of evidence-based interpretation.
3. **Treat key terms as concepts under construction**. Key terms are not assumed to have stable or universal meanings. Participants are expected to track how concepts are defined, contested, and transformed across different texts and historical conditions.
4. **Attend to exclusion and silences**. Analysis must consider not only what a text articulates but also what it leaves out. Silences, omissions, contradictions, and marginal positions are treated as analytically significant rather than incidental.
5. **Produce collective knowledge**. The reading lab values cumulative and collaborative inquiry. Insights generated in discussion are treated as shared intellectual resources that subsequent sessions may revise, challenge, or build upon. The goal is not consensus, but the progressive refinement of questions, concepts, and analytical skills over the course of the semester.
